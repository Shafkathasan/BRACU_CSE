a) To begin the authentication process, a small amount of encrypted data that is issued by a server in the Kerberos authentication model is known as TICKET-GRANTING TICKET (TGT). They are used to obtain tickets that enable access to network resources

b) When Alice present her TGT to the KDC, the KDC can decrypt it, Alice can then use her TGT (credentials) to securely access network resources

c)  Because K KDC is only known by KDC, so others can only get TGT, but can not forge it

d) Extra work and no added security
