In this lab, you will learn loop better through lots of exercise.

Step 1) Read Task1 and Task3 question from Lab.pdf
Step 2) Read FOUR files: Task01, Task03 example with while/for loop
Step 3) Read TWO files: Example of Analysis files.
Step 4) Then read rest of this file.

Please start early so that you can complete all the tasks on or before the lab day.
It is fine to use either while-loop or for-loop to solve these problems.

Please use meaningful variable names, examples:

lineCount  //a counter for running the loop for printing different lines/rows 
linesQuantity // to mean how many lines/rows to be printed 
starCount // a counter for running the loop for printing stars in same line 
starsQuantity // number of stars to be printed 
columnCount // a counter for running the loop for printing numbers in same line 
columnsQuantity // total number of numbers to be printed 
spaceCount // a counter for running the loop for printing spaces in same line 
spaceQuantity // total number of spaces to be printed 
 

pseudo-code for some of the problems:
lineQuantity = sc.nextInt();
lineCount=1; 
while (lineCount<=lineQuantity) 
{
    //calculate how many spaces as f(lines), function of lines/lineCount/etc
    spaces=______ ;  
    spaceCount=1;
    while (.....) // loop for printing "spaces" number of spaces
    {
        System.out.print(' ');
    }
 
    //calculate how many stars as f(lines), function of lines/lineCount/etc
    stars = _______;  
    starCount=1;
    while( .....) // loop for printing "stars" number of stars
    {
        System.out.print('*');
    }

    System.out.println();//print enter, or System.out.print('\n');
    ++lineCount;
}
